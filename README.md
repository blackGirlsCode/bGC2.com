<h1>Welcome to blackGirlsCode(2) Website!</h1>

blackGirlsCode(2) exists to connect and build the community of women of color in technology and close the gap in the digitial divide. It's a safe place for women of color to learn software development and grow in their careers.  
Our members come from different backgrounds, either self-taught or college educated, all with a unique story that has brought them together.  The common thread that binds us is to seek likeness in another and a burning desire to create our very own versions of disruptive technology.

Charlotte, NC is our birthplace, but be advised, we won't stop here. Women of color represent just a small fraction of the technical workforce and that extends globally. 

The curriculum on this site intends to be a guide for the self-directed learner, or supplement for those who are currently going to school, whether at university or a development bootcamp.  

The code is running live at [blackGirlsCode.github.io] (blackGirlsCode.github.io).  Once other features are added, it will be relocated to a more secure site, so please be on the lookout for that announcement.  

We also have a [Slack Channel](https://cltlovescode.slack.com/), and a [Medium](https://medium.com/black-girls-code) Publication in which any member may be a contributing writer.<p>

<h2>Wiki</h2>

We would love to expand our [Wiki](...) and need your help! Our goal is to extend our reach to each and every woman and girl just like us as a resources for people learning to code, and build local coding communities.
